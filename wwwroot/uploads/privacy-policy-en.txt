<p style="text-align: justify;">Ceratec uses cookies to store information about your web site visit, activities, and preferences. A cookie is a small amount of text that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer&rsquo;s hard drive. Most modern browsers automatically accept the placement of the cookie on your computer&rsquo;s hard drive. If you would prefer to prevent your computer from accepting cookies, you can disable cookies from your browser; however, you may not be able to access certain features of Ceratec&rsquo;s website. Like most other commercial websites, our website may monitor traffic patterns, site usage and related sites. We may automatically (i.e., not via registration) collect or compile certain information when you access the website. Examples of this type of information include the aggregate and unique number of visitors to the website, the dates and times of visits to the website, IP addresses and the domains, cities and countries of visitors, the pages of the website visited and the content accessed, the type and version of the browser and operating system used to access the site, search engine and search terms used within the website or to visit the website, referring sites, and HTTP errors generated. We use this information in order to assess the usage of our website and our marketing efforts, to send you tailored browser notifications with news and offers (with your consent), to optimize our website, and to monitor our site&rsquo;s performance. We may provide such information to our website contractors for these purposes. We also may use a web analytics service or services on some pages to improve web design and usability. This may involve recording mouse clicks, mouse movements, scrolling activity as well as any text you type on our websites. Ceratec does not track your browsing habits across websites which do not use the same services. We work with ad content generation third-parties such as Facebook, Google Analytics, and Adobe Analytics to display ads to our site prospects, on our behalf, across the Internet. They collect information about your visits to our website, and your interaction with our products and services. The anonymous information is collected through the use of cookies and pixel tags. We use cookies and other techniques to track your interactions with our website; some of these technologies keep tracking your behavior when cookies are disabled. Pixel tags are industry standard technology used by most major websites. We use this website behaviour information for marketing purposes, system administration and also to identify problems and improve service.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We also use Hotjar in order to better understand our users&rsquo; needs and to optimize this service and experience. Hotjar is a technology service that helps us better understand our users&rsquo; experience (e.g. how much time they spend on which pages, which links they choose to click, what users do and don&rsquo;t like, etc.) and this enables us to build and maintain our service with user feedback. Hotjar uses cookies and other technologies to collect data on our users&rsquo; behavior and their devices. This includes a device's IP address (processed during your session and stored in a de-identified form), device screen size, device type (unique device identifiers), browser information, geographic location (country only), and the preferred language used to display our website. Hotjar stores this information on our behalf in a pseudonymized user profile. Hotjar is contractually forbidden to sell any of the data collected on our behalf.</p>

In relaying an opt-out request to a third-party marketing agency, Ceratec therefore accepts no responsibility for any consequences to the requester arising from the actions of the agency.
